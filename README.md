1. Open your `~/.zshrc` configuration file:

   ```bash
   vim ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Confirm that the `git-checkout-branch` function is defined as shown earlier, without any syntax errors or typos.

3. Save and exit the text editor.

4. After saving the `~/.zshrc` file, source it to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. To test the function, try running it directly in your terminal:

   ```bash
   function git-checkout-branch() {
       local branch_name="$1"
       local formatted_branch_name

       # Replace spaces with dashes in the branch name
       formatted_branch_name=$(echo "$branch_name" | sed 's/ /-/g')

       # Execute the 'git checkout -b' command with the modified branch name
       git checkout -b "$formatted_branch_name"
   }

   git-checkout-branch "fix/this is a test"
   ```

This will allow you to verify if the function works as intended. If it does, but it doesn't work when sourced from `~/.zshrc`, then there might be a configuration issue within your Zsh initialization files or environment. In that case, you should check for any other Zsh configuration files that might affect the behavior of functions.
